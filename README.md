# CitiServe – Database Setup (citiserve_db)

This document explains the **MySQL database structure** for CitiServe and how to **import** it using phpMyAdmin so that every group member has the same tables and sample data.

---

To access the system go to localhost/CitiServe/public

Before Pushing Please export citiserve_db then put it in the Citiserve folder so if you made any changes we can just import it back and forth


## Local database configuration - IMPORTANT!!!!!!!! This is how you can see it when you clone this repo
PLEASE READ NUMBER 3 IN THE OVERVIEW TO IMPORT THE DATABASE FIRST THEN YOU CAN FOLLOW THIS STEP

1. **Create the database and import data**
   - Open phpMyAdmin (e.g., `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
   - Create a database named `citiserve_db`.
   - Select `citiserve_db` → **Import** tab.
   - Select file `citiserve_db.sql`
   - Click **Go**.

2. **Configure your local database connection**
   - Copy the example config:

     open the folder app/config/select database.php 

   - Open `app/config/database.php` and set:
     - `database` → the name of your DB (usually `citiserve_db`)
     - `username` → your own MySQL/phpMyAdmin username  
       (for example, `root` or `phpmyadmin`)
     - `password` → your own MySQL/phpMyAdmin password

3. **Test the connection**
   - Open in your browser:

     `http://localhost/CitiServe/public/test_services.php`

   - You should see a “Connected to citiserve_db” message and a list of document services.






## 1. Overview

Database name (recommended): **`citiserve_db`**

CitiServe is a web-based Barangay Complaint Management and Document Request System.  
The database mainly covers:

- **User accounts** (residents, staff, admin)
- **Barangay document services** and **requests**
- **Complaint categories**, **complaint records**, and **complaint evidence**
- **Notifications** for users
- **Status history** tracking for document requests and complaints

You will find an SQL export file in this project:

- `database/citiserve_latest.sql`

Importing this file will automatically create all required tables and insert some initial records (e.g., document services, complaint categories).

## 3. How to import the database (for group members)

Follow these steps to set up the CitiServe database on your own computer.

### 3.1 Requirements

- Local web server (XAMPP/WAMP/LAMP, etc.).
- MySQL running.
- phpMyAdmin accessible (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).

### 3.2 Steps to import `citiserve_latest.sql`

1. **Open phpMyAdmin**

   - Go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your browser.
   - Log in with your MySQL username and password  
     (often `root` with no password on local setups, unless you changed it).

2. **Create a new database**

   - Click the **Databases** tab at the top.
   - In **Create database**, enter:  
     `citiserve_db`
   - Choose collation: `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` (recommended).
   - Click **Create**.

3. **Select the new database**

   - In the left sidebar, click **`citiserve_db`**.

4. **Import the SQL file**

   - With `citiserve_db` selected, click the **Import** tab at the top.
   - Click **Choose File** (or **Browse**).
   - Navigate to the project folder and select:

     `database/citiserve_latest.sql`

   - Make sure the format is **SQL**.
   - Click **Go**.

5. **Wait for completion**

   - If the import is successful, you will see a green success message.
   - In the left sidebar, under `citiserve_db`, you should now see tables like:
     - `users`
     - `document_services`
     - `document_requests`
     - `complaint_categories`
     - `complaints`
     - `complaint_evidence`
     - `notifications`
     - `status_history`

You now have the same database structure and sample data as the original developer.

## 4. Common issues & quick fixes

- **Error: Table already exists**

  - This used to happen when re-importing `citiserve_db.sql` on a database that already had the tables.
  - Fix: The SQL file now uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `INSERT IGNORE`, so you can safely re-import it without dropping existing tables. Just import it again through phpMyAdmin and it will skip anything that already exists.

- **Error: Unknown database `citiserve_db`**

  - You forgot to create the database before importing.
  - Fix: Go to **Databases** → create `citiserve_db` → select it → then import.

- **Error: Access denied for user**

  - Your MySQL username/password are incorrect.
  - Fix: Use the same credentials you normally use to log in to phpMyAdmin.

- **After import, I see no tables**

  - You may have imported into the wrong database or import failed.
  - Fix: Make sure you select `citiserve_db` in the left sidebar **before** importing.
  - Check the message at the top of phpMyAdmin for any errors.

## 5. Next steps (for developers)

After successfully importing `citiserve_db`:

1. Configure your PHP project to connect to this database (e.g., in `app/config/database.php`).
2. Use the tables described above to:
   - Implement registration
